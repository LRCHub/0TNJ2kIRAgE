[00:00.89] do I gotta lie for the sake of your faith？
[00:10.06] everything that I ever longed for
[00:14.77] slowly decays in front of my eyes
[00:22.06] she said god doesn't falter…
[00:27.46] enough with the fake happy ever after
[00:33.53] it won't end in grace:(
[00:36.41] I feel it fracturing my mind
[00:42.84] broken
[00:44.49] it's like my liver is bleeding in purple
[00:51.42] am I making sense？？
[00:53.68] now that the tears have dried
[00:56.34] my soul will crave for you
[01:02.21] I thirst for love
[01:06.49] 頭の中、感覚、甘くて苦い
[01:11.25] 焼けるような37℃の頭で
[01:15.65] 1度でも壊れてしまったなら最期
[01:19.77] 生きながらえるかも分からないまま
[01:24.17] baby tell me is it too late？
[01:27.82] my body, my soul, my flesh, my bones
[01:29.82] was I ever really full？
[01:33.53] idk
[01:34.54] idk(T ^ T)
[01:39.54] 
[01:37.34] do I gotta lie for the sake of your faith？
[01:45.50] (htiaf ruoy fo ekas eht)
[01:47.30] frozen inside
[01:49.66] my system keeps spinning in circles
[01:55.54] my head is a mess
[01:57.75] how could I get a grasp of what's been breaking me
[02:07.49] cause I've stayed broken
[02:10.07] it's like my liver is bleeding in purple
[02:16.86] am I making sense？？
[02:19.38] now that the tears have dried
[02:21.95] my soul will crave for you
[02:27.82] (叫)
[02:28.38] I thirst for love
[02:29.42] あー
[02:32.19] あーあーあー
[02:39.24] あーあーあー
[02:42.75] あーあーあー
[02:48.07] あーあああー
